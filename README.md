# Reddit - NSFW
Detection of potential nudity in images using Convolutional Neural Networks in Python with Keras

# Preface
In the below article, 'NSFW' stands for 'Not Safe for Work', synonymous to images containing nudity, gore, violence, drugs etc. However, for the purpose of this article, 'NSFW' refers solely to images containing nudity.
'SFW' refers to images or objects which are 'Safe for Work', in other words, which do not contain any of the above stated negatives whatsoever.

Owing to GitHub's terms of service, I can neither upload the dataset containing nudity nor directly link to any such dataset. However, if you wish to run this model yourself, clone the repository and manually download the dataset as specified below.
